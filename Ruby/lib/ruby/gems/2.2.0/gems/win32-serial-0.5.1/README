== Win32Serial Extension Library (win32-serial)

Simple extension library to access Windows serial ports (COM ports) using the
Windows API. Originally written Apr. 10, 2006 by Travis Whitton 
&lt; whitton@atlantic.net &gt;

Gem conversion, organization and binary releases by Jeff Rafter. 

== Example

It is possible to use the library directly:

  require 'Win32Serial'
  port = 'COM1'
  s = Win32Serial.new
  s.open(port)
  s.config(9600, 8, Win32Serial::NOPARITY, Win32Serial::ONESTOPBIT)
  s.timeouts(0, 200, 0, 0, 0)
  bytes = s.write("AT+CGMI\r") || "< no bytes >"
  puts "#{bytes} bytes written to #{port}"
  puts "response " + (s.read(14) || " < no response >")
  s.close

A compatibility layer has been added which allows you to access the library
using a SerialPort class as well:

  require 'serialport'
  sp = SerialPort.new('COM1', 9600, 8, 1, SerialPort::NONE)
  sp.write("AT")
  sp.read(14)
  sp.close
  
In addition to write and read, getc is implemented for single byte reads. putc 
is also implemented for single byte writes.

== Installation

Assuming you have a development environment on the target Windows machine you
can simply install the Gem normally. Alternatively, binary gem releases are 
included in the bin folder and can be downloaded. These binary releases are
compiled using mingw and contain the Win32Serial.so, so no compilation on the
target Windows machine is necessary. These releases may not be compatible with
JRuby, Rubinius and other ruby implementations.
